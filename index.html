            <h3>The Idea</h3>
            <p>     
            HealthAlert allows users to monitor important vital statistics of their family and friends.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <h3> The Application </h3>
            <p>     
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Health Alert</b> is a service that will alert the patients about their health based on the data that is being collected by health devices that are associated with Health Kit. Although it is not an replacement for our international emergency number 911, it provide an ease to family members or friends that cares for the well-being of their loved ones. The alert system also extends to the patients's doctors (if they decides to do so). This allows doctors to stay on top of what the current health situation of their patients are and be prepare to handle the situation of something dire were to happen for patients that are already in critical condition.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, <b>Health Alert</b> is only for iO-8 and designed to fit the iPhone 6. It is developed in Swift, intergrated with the Twilio (message and calling service) and Health Kit. The backend databased of this application is a MySQL database with query scripts written in PHP. The app itself would require access to wireless internet or cellular internet in order to retrive data from the database as well as executing notifications.
