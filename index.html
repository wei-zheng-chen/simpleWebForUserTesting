            <h3>The Idea</h3>
            <p>     
            HealthAlert allows users to monitor important vital statistics of their family and friends. Doing this is simple: connect your devices to your iPod or iPhone, put in the phone numbers of the family and friends you want to be notified when a health event occurs, and our app does the rest of the work!

            <h3> The Technology </h3>
            <p>     
            One of the main new features of iOS 8, Apple's new mobile operating system, is an application called HealthKit. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/healthkit/">HealthKit</a> gives iPhone and iPad users to have a central location where all of their health data is aggregated. Our application leverages the data that HealthKit culls from a variety of different devices to send notifications to family and friends based on monitoring statistics. The best part is that the alerted parties do not need to install any additional software on their devices. All of our notifications are done via phone call and text message. Users are also able to control who is notified for each health statistic, and by which medium we contact them.
